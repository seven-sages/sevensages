            The Seven Sages of Rome is the most famous premodern text of which nobody has ever heard, and this project aims to change that. This story cycle, told in at least 30 languages from Central Asia to Iceland over more than five centuries, centres on a non-sensual sexual encounter between a mute prince and his stepmother.
