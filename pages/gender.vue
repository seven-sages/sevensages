        This project contributes to gender studies by showing how gender was not understood as a pre-existent binary, but rhetorically constructed and negotiated as a spectrum in The Seven Sages as one of the most influential cultural artefacts of the Middle Ages and early modernity. The Seven Sages acknowledged the artificiality of such as gender binary and discussed alternatives such as cross-dressing and changing gender, as well as the violence it takes ultimately to uphold the hierarchical gender binary. As regards the state of research on gender in The Seven Sages specifically, the text is commonly identified as misogynistic, due to its explicitly voiced distrust of all women, and the portrayal of the female protagonist in the frame narrative as the apparent villain: a vindicative, mendacious, lustful femme fatale. We propose a fresh start: while not denying the misogynistic gist, we allow for the possibility of emancipatory counter-readings, reconsidering how the text situates the female protagonist in a gendered power distribution and allows her to spell out her difficulties with it: for instance, her insecure position as a woman of high nobility without children of her own, or a marriage to a much older man unable to satisfy her sexually. In this vein, we envisage as a focal point intersectional studies of the relationship between gender, social status, sexuality, ethnicity and religion, which can help to understand if and how the transcultural transmission of the narrative matter affects its content. We will look at the strategies by which recipients become biased against the female characters, and how the embedded tales intersect with the gender of their narrators.
