        Our project contributes to genre studies by laying the theoretical and practical foundations for a conceptualization of the The Seven Sages as a multilingual and transcultural narrative. We hold that due to its popularity, The Seven Sages is uniquely placed to give insights into literary history in its global dimensions. Especially its multilingual traditions with their many transcultural and interreligious links cannot be adequately understood within the parameters of current research, which has split the transmission into separate “Eastern”/”Oriental” and “Western” corpuses, further divided it by modern national languages, and attempted to identify a monolingual “original”. Instead we consider the individual manuscripts and prints as part of the transmission as a whole, written in a milieu in which polyglot communication was the norm. Instead of aiming at a comprehensive literary history tracing the earliest to the latest transmission and the “rise and decline” of genres, we hold that genres do not need to have a clear and identifiable starting point, evolve at times simultaneously in different cultures, and/or engage in different transcultural entanglements. They peak and intensify irregularly and asynchronically and can stretch across extremely long periods of time and different regions of the world. Contrary to what traditional genre theory holds, such wide and long distribution does not weaken generic features, but makes them even more recognizable, in a way that will here be traced for the Seven Sages versions. We also hold that the common label of the narrative as a “story cycle” or “story compilation” is in many cases misleading, and that there is good reason to consider it a novel instead.
